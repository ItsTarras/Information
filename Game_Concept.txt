Concept Idea:
-A wasteland. Not like fallout or a generic desert.
Make the world feel alive and mildly magical.

- The character can't attack. Ever. like ever. Similar to Abe's Odyssey.

- The world is in chaos. War has broken out between many civilisations,
and the story we follow, is that of a civilian.
